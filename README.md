# Introduction:
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company by leveraging machine learning techniques. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services, can have significant financial implications for businesses. To address this, the project combines demographic and usage data obtained from two separate datasets, 'telecom_demographics.csv' and 'telecom_usage.csv.' After merging these datasets, the exploratory data analysis examines the distribution of features and the target variable, shedding light on potential patterns within the data. The goal is to develop a predictive model capable of identifying customers at risk of churning, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain its customer base.

# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
The preprocessing stage involves converting categorical variables into a suitable format for machine learning models using one-hot encoding. Additionally, the dataset undergoes standardization to ensure uniformity in feature scales. The project employs two different classifiers—Logistic Regression and RandomForest—to capture various aspects of the underlying patterns. The training and evaluation process involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the models, and assessing their performance using metrics such as confusion matrices and classification reports. The choice of models and their hyperparameters is a crucial aspect of the project, with an emphasis on achieving a balance between accuracy and generalizability.

# Model Evaluation and Conclusion:
The final part of the project evaluates the performance of the trained models on the test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score provide a comprehensive understanding of each model's strengths and weaknesses. The project concludes by selecting the model with the highest accuracy—RandomForest, in this case. However, it emphasizes the importance of considering other metrics and the specific business context when choosing the optimal model. The predictive capabilities of the chosen model could empower the telecom company to proactively address customer churn, potentially leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and financial stability. Further iterations and refinements of the model may be pursued to continually improve its predictive accuracy and real-world applicability.
